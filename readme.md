# Anime Recommendation System

This project is a web-based Anime Recommendation System built with Python and FastAPI. It uses a content-based filtering model (based on anime genres) to suggest new anime based on a user's selection.

## 🚀 Technology Used

* **Backend:** Python, [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/)
* **Data Science & ML:** [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) (for similarity matrix), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* **Frontend:** HTML, JavaScript
* **Database/Auth:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (using `firebase-admin`)
* **Templating:** [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/)
* **Utilities:** `python-dotenv` (for environment variables), `python-multipart` (for form data)

## ⚙️ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* `venv` (for creating virtual environments, usually included with Python)

### 2. Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shadow-gard3n/anime-recommendation.git](https://github.com/shadow-gard3n/anime-recommendation.git)
    cd anime-recommendation
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment** (venv):

    *On macOS/Linux:*
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    *On Windows:*
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. Generate the Similarity Matrix

Before you can run the web application, you must first **run the Jupyter Notebook** to process the data and create the "similarity matrix" file that the recommendation model needs.

1.  Make sure you have Jupyter installed in your venv:
    ```bash
    pip install jupyter
    ```
2.  Start the Jupyter Notebook server:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3.  In the browser window that opens, navigate to the `notebook/` directory and open **`Anime_Genre.ipynb`** (or `Anime_Genre (2).ipynb`).
4.  Run all the cells in the notebook. This will read the `anime.csv`, process the data, and save the resulting similarity matrix (likely as a `.pkl` file).

### 4. Running the Application

Once the setup is complete and the similarity matrix has been generated by the notebook, you can run the main application.

Make sure you are in the **root directory** (the one containing `main.py`).

1.  **Run the Uvicorn server**:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
2.  Open your web browser and go to the following address:
